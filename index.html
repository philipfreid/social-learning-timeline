						<p>My memories of childhood are fuzzy, warm and are reminiscent of my dog Tess who was my best friend. I would say my social learning journey started at a very young age because 
							it was always my preference to work in groups, learning from others and copying the answers from the smart kids!

						<h4>Safety in numbers</h4>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I kind of stumbled my way into JPMC, I didn't have a clear plan nor did I know what direction I wanted to take. But I started my internship and immediately enjoyed a network with 
							my peer group where we would socialise together and sometimes help each other out on project work. 
							This was good because otherwise J.P. Morgan was a pretty terrifying place to be.

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Having moved around various roles I found myself in a terrible project with unbearable stress. By this time I was completely institutionalised and was too afraid to leave the company.
							But it was time for a change!

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I found a new role in a different part of the company, and within the domain of agile I found a home. It was somewhere I could be creative, try new things, bring people together and
							it brought me more job satisfaction than I'd ever had before. 
							To try to establish THIS as my new niche, I offered to run some big retrospectives in New York. It worked - and it brought major improvements to our program and teams. 						
						</p>
						<p>This was a photo I took from the plane on my way into New York JFK, now feeling positive and optimistic instead of enslaved and in the dark.</p>
						<p>Enabling people to feel a sense of belonging, to help turn them into optimists. That was the thing I enjoyed and this was my new way of doing it.</p>

						<p>Ignite is born. We tried it in Glasgow, people lapped up the opportunity to raise their periscopes and see the world outside.</p>
						<p>Our stunt in front of senior leaders pays off, and we're asked to take our social learning initiative firmwide.</p>

						<h4>A major milestone</h4>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Our trip to California will truly be a lifelong memory for me. I had just come back from a period of ill health and I wasn't sure if I should go to the BETreat</p>
						<p>But what a TREAT it was - I experienced so many new things that week:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Travelled to the West Coast and saw the Pacific Ocean for the first time</li>
							<li>Rode in a Mustang (albeit it wasn't a 1969 model!)</li>
							<li>Saw San Francisco - this was #1 on my wish list of cities to visit</li>
							<li>Truly <strong>grasped</strong> what social learning really means, and learned so much about what I need to do</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It is a privilege to be able to do this - to spend most of my days talking to people about things they're passionate about, to see the excitement time and time again
							from those who want to learn from each other in new ways, forge their own new horizons and get better at the things they care about.

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Our initiative has grown to a huge scale in a very short period of time, but this brings its own set of challenges.</p>
						<p>We seek ways to educate people on the new social learning paradigms we've learned and make social learning truly a part of the culture of daily life at J.P. Morgan.</p>
