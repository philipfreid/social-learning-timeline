						<p>My memories of childhood are fuzzy, warm and are reminiscent of my dog Tess who was my best friend. I would say my social learning journey started at a very young age because 
							it was always my preference to work in groups, learning from others and copying the answers from the smart kids!

						<p>I kind of stumbled my way into JPMC, I didn't have a clear plan nor did I know what direction I wanted to take. But I started my internship and immediately enjoyed a network with 
							my peer group where we would socialise together and sometimes help each other out on project work. 
							This was good because otherwise J.P. Morgan was a pretty terrifying place to be.

						<p>Having moved around various roles I found myself in a terrible project with unbearable stress. By this time I was completely institutionalised and was too afraid to leave the company.
							But it was time for a change!
